# Churn-Rate-Modelling
Churn’s prediction could be a great asset in the business strategy for retention applying before the exit of customers.

This is an international Bank with millions of customers spread all around Europe mainly in, three countries, Spain, France and Germany. In the last six months the bank detected that the churn rates started to increase when compared to the average rate, so they decided to take measures. The bank decided to take a small sample of 10,000 of their customers and retrieve some information.

For six months they followed the behaviour of these 10,000 customers and analysed which stayed and who left the bank. Therefore, they want us to develop a model that can measure the probability of a customer leaving the bank.

Our goal for this task is to create a geodemographic segmentation model to tell the bank which of the customers are at higher risk to leave.
